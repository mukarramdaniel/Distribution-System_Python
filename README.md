## Description: 
We are facing not just a challenging business environment but a rapidly changing one. There
is always room for improvement. Running a Distribution System without a proper application
can lead to many problems. In the warehouse, by not managing your stock count, cost price
changes and not being able to view your stock position can have drastic consequences. The
company has no way of knowing how much stock is left in your warehouses and how much
you’ve sold out. If you don’t know how much you have left, you can’t restock your inventory
which will cause delays and frustrate your customers. It is important to track your inventory
so that you can plan ahead effectively. The company is unable to keep a record of its employees,
day-to-day sales and profits, customer information and transportation cost. Searching
a 10-year-old record for the company is extremely challenging. Speed is also critical when
ensuring that you get the correct items picked, packed and distributed to the correct address
and client. Understanding the right approach to solving these challenges is essential for distributors
to adapt, transform and differentiate themselves in this new challenging business
landscape.
We are all aware that we live in an increasing electronic world. Simply put if the Distribution
Company is not using a proper, well-managed application then it is facing commercial suicide.
So, our Project aims to develop such an application for the Company that can address all
the above problems and help the company improve the distribution system and management
of the company processes.
The administrator of the application is the General Manager of the company. He can hire the
company employees (sales agent), riders (to deliver the packages) and an inventory Manager.
He is in the charge of each module. Each employee would have their individual accounts.
The inventory Manager is in charge of the warehouse, keeping the record of the product as
being delivered by the Manufacturing Company. The sales agent will deal with the clients,
their orders and assign the delivery task to the riders depending upon the location assigned
to them. The rider would be a given a specific area in which he would have to deliver all the
goods and complete all its orders in the given time. Further bonuses will be given according
to the statistic chart at the end of the month.
The Distribution Company that we have plumped for is the Shoe Distribution Company. A
well-recognized shoe Manufacturing Company ADIDAS is our manufacturer. The implementation
of this application will work with a company called ARM. As a distribution company
we deliver the products to numerous retailers, wholesalers, concept stores, buyers and agents
all over the Lahore. It operates on its own as it is an independent company establishing a
connection between the products and the client.
The Record and performance are also evaluated automatically in order to provide the appraisal.
The company established the excellent track record for the best customer satisfaction. As a
footwear sourcing company, we also provide sustainable material sourcing options to help our
clients choose a greener path. An organization’s main focus must be to satisfy its customers
and in order to do so we are providing a refund policy for the client and email verification
after the order had been sent to them. Sometimes, the rider doesn’t deliver the parcel to the
exact location. So, to overcome this problem we provide the rider with the exact location of client on Google map. The client should place the minimum required order then the sales
agent would request the inventory manager for the confirmation of the stock. The application
also maintains the daily attendance of the employees, the scheduling of the riders and fuel
consumption cost. The clients would also be informed of the special offers. Our system is
cited as the most efficient tool that is at the company’s disposal.
The application offers three modes.

• Manager authorized mode.

• Sales Agent authorized mode.

• Inventory Supervisor mode

• Rider authorized mode.

## Project Features:
• User interface screen will be operated according to the role of the person who signs in.

• Client can pay in installments or pay in advance.

• Rider will be informed with the stock availability during placing orders. If the required order
of the client is out of stock, order could not be placed and an email would be sent to the
Inventory Supervisor to inform about stock unavailability.

• Sales Agent will assign the location of decided area to the Rider. The rider will take order
and will be delivered the very next day.

• Rider have facility of using maps that give the route of minimum journey to deliver all the
orders.

• Maintain record of Attendance of all employees.

• Management of salaries and bonuses for employees.

• Password reset feature for users account via Email.
